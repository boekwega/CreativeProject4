In lab 4, we have so many different folders. We have bin, node_modules, public, routes, views. Do we need all of these folders in our creative project? What do they all do and what can we get rid of?

Do we need to install node again? Does not need to be installed in each folder? Am I talking about this the right way? Should I have said "express" rather than "node"?

Perhaps one way to begin is to copy all of the lab 4 files into the creative project folder and then modify them. Then I'd probably have all the whatnots that are needed to hook things up. I guess my fear is that by doing that, I'd also have way too much stuff and stuff that I don't need. So that makes me thing that I should go through the two hour node tutorials so that I can really understand what everything is doing. But maybe those tutorials aren't going to tell me what the "bin" folder is for. So maybe that will just be a waste of time. I don't know. 

The beauty of github is that it's making it very safe to do stupid things. Let's switch to a new branch, copy in all of the files from lab 4 and then just muck about with them. I can always go back to a clean directory if things snarle.
